/**
 * This is a configuration class used by {@link MessageUtils} to control the sending of temporary messages in Discord. When
 * a method is used that sends a temporary message, it requires a {@link com.github.kwilinsi.jda.command.manager.tools.TempMsgConfig} instance to
 * know how long to keep the message in Discord before deleting it.
 * <p><br>
 * Configuration instances have two parameters: a {@link #base} and a {@link #factor}. The {@link #base} sets the
 * minimum number of seconds the message must remain before being deleted. No message will be deleted before the base
 * seconds elapse. The {@link #factor} adjusts the time that the message lasts based on how long the message would take
 * the average person to read. For each {@link #factor} number of characters in the message, an additional 1 second is
 * added to the time it lasts.
 * <p><br>
 * For example, if you used {@link #of(int, float)} to create a configuration instance with a {@link #base} of 10 and a
 * {@link #factor} of 12, a message with 100 characters would last for {@code 10 + floor(100 / 12) = 18} seconds.
 * <p><br>
 * If you don't want to manually define the configuration parameters yourself, you can use the predefined constants
 * {@link #SLOW_SPEED}, {@link #DEFAULT_SPEED}, and {@link #FAST_SPEED}, which are set up based on the default reading
 * speed of adults according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Reading_and_comprehension">
 * Wikipedia</a>.
